# Awaked

A social network for NFTs that uses Ceramic Network streams and W3C DIDs to build an off-chain IPFS-based decentralized social graph for NFTs. Awaked uses the NFT DID specification, allowing the owner of a particular NFT to create and update content that belogs to the NFT itself. If the NFT gets sold the rights to the NFT-associated content are also transferred.

# Indexing

Awaked uses firebase as a temporary way to index documents.
